Project Report: Doctor Booking Application (MERN Stack)
1. Project Overview
The Doctor Booking Application aims to provide an online platform for patients to book appointments with doctors and for doctors to manage their schedules. It leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to deliver a seamless and responsive user experience.

2. System Architecture
The application is structured as follows:

Frontend: Built with React.js, it includes various components for user authentication, dashboards, profile management, and appointment booking.
Backend: Implemented using Node.js and Express.js, it includes APIs for user authentication, profile management, and appointment handling.
Database: MongoDB is used to store user data, appointment details, and doctor availability.
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for secure authentication and role-based access control.
3. Frontend Details
Components: Divided into Auth (Login, Register), Dashboard (PatientDashboard, DoctorDashboard), Appointments (BookAppointment, AppointmentList), and Profile (PatientProfile, DoctorProfile).
State Management: Managed using React Context or Redux for global state.
API Integration: Centralized in a service file for making HTTP requests to the backend.
4. Backend Details
Controllers: Handle the core business logic for authentication, user management, doctor management, and appointments.
Models: Define Mongoose schemas for User, Appointment, and DoctorAvailability.
Routes: Define endpoints for authentication, user profiles, doctor information, and appointments.
Middleware: Includes authMiddleware for JWT verification and errorMiddleware for error handling.
Utilities: Functions for generating and verifying JWT tokens.
5. Database Design
Users Collection: Stores user information (patients, doctors) and their roles.
Appointments Collection: Stores appointment details including patient ID, doctor ID, date, and status.
DoctorAvailability Collection: Stores doctors' available time slots.
6. Key Features
User Authentication: Secure login and registration for patients and doctors.
Role-Based Access Control: Differentiated access for patients and doctors.
Profile Management: Allows users to view and update their profiles.
Appointment Booking: Enables patients to book appointments with doctors.
Doctor Availability Management: Allows doctors to set their available time slots.
Admin Panel: For managing users and appointments (if implemented).
7. Wireframes
Login Page: Fields for email and password, buttons for login and navigation to registration.
Register Page: Fields for name, email, password, role selection, and buttons for registration and navigation to login.
Dashboards: Separate dashboards for patients and doctors displaying relevant information and options.
Profile Pages: Editable profile information for patients and doctors.
Appointment Management: Pages for booking and listing appointments, managing doctor availability.
Admin Panel: Section for managing users and appointments.
8. Deployment
Frontend: Deployed on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS S3.
Backend: Deployed on platforms like Heroku, AWS EC2, or DigitalOcean.
Database: MongoDB Atlas for managed database hosting.
9. Conclusion
The Doctor Booking Application streamlines the process of scheduling medical appointments, providing a robust platform for both patients and doctors. The use of the MERN stack ensures a scalable and maintainable application, while JWT-based authentication guarantees secure access control.
