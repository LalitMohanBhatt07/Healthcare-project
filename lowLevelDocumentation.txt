User Model: Stores user information, including roles (patient, doctor).
Appointment Model: Stores appointment details (patient ID, doctor ID, date, status).
Doctor Availability Model: Stores available time slots for doctors.
Controllers

Auth Controller: Manages registration, login, and logout processes.
User Controller: Handles retrieving and updating user profile information.
Doctor Controller: Manages fetching doctor lists and setting availability.
Appointment Controller: Handles booking, retrieving, and managing appointments.
Routes

Auth Routes: Endpoints for user registration and login.
User Routes: Endpoints for retrieving and updating user profiles.
Doctor Routes: Endpoints for fetching doctor information and setting availability.

Error Middleware: Handles errors and sends appropriate responses to the client.
Utilities

JWT Utils: Utility functions for generating and verifying JWT tokens.
Server Initialization

Initializes the Express application.
Connects to the MongoDB database.
Sets up routes and middleware.
Starts the server and listens on the specified port.
Database (MongoDB)
Collections
Users Collection
Stores user data, including roles (patient, doctor).
Appointments Collection
Stores appointment details (patient ID, doctor ID, date, status).
DoctorAvailability Collection
Stores available time slots for doctors.
Authentication and Authorization
JWT Tokens
Used for securing API endpoints.
Issued upon successful login and stored on the client-side.
Role-Based Access Control
Middleware checks user roles and permissions for accessing specific routes.
Deployment
Frontend Deployment
Deployed on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS S3.
Backend Deployment
Deployed on platforms like Heroku, AWS EC2, or DigitalOcean.
Database Deployment
MongoDB Atlas for managed database hosting and scaling.
