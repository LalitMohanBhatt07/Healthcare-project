High-Level Architecture
1. Frontend (React.js)
Components:

Authentication: Login, Register
Dashboard: Patient Dashboard, Doctor Dashboard
Profile Management: Profile View and Edit for both Patients and Doctors
Booking Management: Search Doctors, Book Appointment, Appointment List
Admin Panel: User Management, Appointment Management
State Management: Redux or React Context API

Routing: React Router for navigation

API Integration: Axios or Fetch for making API requests

2. Backend (Node.js with Express.js)
Server Setup:
Main server file (server.js or app.js) initializing Express app and connecting to MongoDB.
Routes:
Auth Routes: Registration, Login, Logout
User Routes: Profile Management, Get User Details
Doctor Routes: Get Doctor List, Doctor Availability
Appointment Routes: Book Appointment, Get Appointments, Manage Appointments
Middleware:
Authentication Middleware using JWT
Error Handling Middleware
Validation Middleware for request data
Controllers:
Business logic for handling requests and interacting with the database.
Models (Mongoose):
User Model
Appointment Model
Doctor Availability Model
3. Database (MongoDB)
Collections:
Users: Stores patient and doctor information
Appointments: Stores appointment details
DoctorAvailability: Stores doctor availability slots
4. Authentication and Authorization
JWT Tokens:
Used for securing API endpoints and managing user sessions.
Role-Based Access Control:
Different roles for Patients, Doctors, and Admins with specific permissions.
5. Deployment
Frontend Deployment:
Platforms: Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3
Backend Deployment:
Platforms: Heroku, AWS EC2, DigitalOcean
Database Deployment:
MongoDB Atlas for managed MongoDB hosting
